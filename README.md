# etch-a-sketch
This is a webpage version of the toy [Etch A Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) using only HTML, CSS and Javascript.

When the mouse button hovers over the white screen, each square in the grid gets filled with a random color, and if you hover over a same square again, it will darken by 10%.

By doing this project, I will have demonstrated my DOM manipulation and flexbox skills.
